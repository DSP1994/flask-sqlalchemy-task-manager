when starting up github make sure to install the Flask-SQLAlchemy and psycopg2
- pip3 install Flask-SQLAlchemy psycopg2 
DO THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE!!!!

python3 run.py - to launch

if you can't get into the psql - remember to use set_pg and try again

then to create a database use 'CREATE DATABASE taskmanager;'
then use - '\c taskmanager;' to access it
use \q to quit

Need to use Python to geneerate and migrate the models to the new database.
to do this type;
1 'python3'
2 'from taskmanager import db
3 'db.create_all()'
4 'exit()'
To confirm
5 psql -d taskmanager
6 \dt

if there's an issue with the app, do a hard restart (ctrl shit r) and if that doesn't work, in the terminal do (crtl+c) to quit and restart the app.
